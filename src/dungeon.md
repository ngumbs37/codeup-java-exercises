Console Adventure Game!
Today you’ll be pairing up with a sidekick to go on a little adventure in Java.

You’ll be creating a text based RPG in your console!

 – Allow user to input their hero name.

 –Ask if they are ready to start. If yes, then start the game.

 –Give a display of enemy stats and hero stats. These values can be assigned by you.

 –Decide on what actions your hero can take. 

 – For example:
1.	Attack (each time 1 is input, enemy health should decrease)
2.	Drink potion (adds to hero health.)
3.	Run? (ends the game)
–	Keep asking for user input until the enemy health reaches 0, then end the game.
**BONUS:
–	allow user to input enemy name.
–	have the enemy attack the hero to decrease heroHealth after each time the hero takes an action
–	if heroHealth reaches 0 before the enemy’s end game with message “Game Over.”
–	Indicate how many potions your hero starts with. Decrement each time this action is used.

~ Have fun and get creative!~
